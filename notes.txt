Notes:  



1) Only built it to change a managed account with a functional account.  all other SDK actions werent done cuz im lazy.  so no FA testing or anything.  that can be implemented, but this was a one off so i didnt

2) The "change managed account with functional account" file in the "Actions Folder" file has a file path where the script to change the PWS needs to live.  its set to c:\test\syncpwstopra.ps1 by default, but you can open the action file in an editor to view it or change it.

3) The script in the SRA Sync Plugin dir needs to have your SRA site and client id and secret input.  I think i put the script on the RB/UVM, as it i s just doing API calls, nothing on the local system.

4) You'll need to recompile the plugin in Visual Studio once you've made the changes in the Actions folder, but the script can be changed after compiling.  There is a doc in the "Documents" folder that details how to use the SDK to generate a plugin.
